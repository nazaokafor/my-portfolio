My Portfolio

A portfolio is one of the best ways to showcase a web developer's talent on numerous projects that address the current challenges of user-friendly applications and software. 

This week's challenge was to build an entire webpage from scratch, using HTML and CSS to create a presentation that sells our best attributes as an aspiring developer. 

The following features were integrated onto the webpage to deliver a highly engaging interface:

1. Webpage responsiveness on various electronic devices with the use of CSS elements such as media query and flex box attributes. 

2. Deployed web applications embedded within images that describe previous and on-going projects. 

As I was working on this project, I realized that the use of flex box elements are essential for the visual organization of websites in general. Additionally, I learned that media queries are important for promoting user engagement on apps and websites.

A big challenge I faced while working on this project was with the arrangement my flexbox images to be aligned with their headings. Moreover, I experienced quite a bit of trouble  integrating shadow box colors on my images as the cursor hovers over them. In spite of these difficulties, I view this week's exercise as a pointer to areas I need to improve on with my flexbox and media query skills in the duration of this bootcamp.
